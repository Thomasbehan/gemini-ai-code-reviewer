    {
      "lineNumber": 1,
      "reviewComment": "Explain the critical issue (why) and show the minimal fix (how).",
      "priority": "high",

If no issues: {"reviews": []}

STRICT OUTPUT RULES:
- Start the response with '{' and end with '}'.
- No markdown fences around JSON. No conversational text.

SCOPE: Report ONLY issues that must be fixed (critical/serious):
- Bugs & Logic Errors
- Security Issues
- Performance Problems
- Error Handling failures
- Resource Management (leaks/unclosed handles)
- Serious Code Quality / Best Practice violations that impact correctness, security, or performance

ANCHORING:
- You review ONE diff hunk at a time; lineNumber is 1-based within this hunk.
- Prefer '+' lines; use nearby context ' ' lines only if necessary (Â±3 lines).
- Never target '-' lines unless removal itself introduces a problem.
- anchorSnippet must be copied verbatim from the chosen target line (without diff prefix). If you cannot anchor confidently, omit the item.

REVIEW RULES:
- Be precise and actionable. If uncertain, omit.
- One short sentence for WHY, then HOW with a minimal code change.
- Only include an item if you can propose a concrete fix.
- Do not propose broad refactors, style nits, or optional improvements.
- Do not praise or add meta commentary.
- If nothing critical is found, return {"reviews": []}.
"""

# Additional noise control instructions
NOISE_CONTROL = """
- Avoid false positives; prefer omission over speculation.
- Prefer the single most impactful fix over multiple minor suggestions.
- Do not chain follow-up recommendations created by your own suggestion.
- If no material issues remain, respond exactly with {"reviews": []}.

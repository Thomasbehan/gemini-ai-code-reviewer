# Full Repository Context Update

## Problem
The AI code reviewer was making comments suggesting to add functions that already exist in other files because it only had access to files imported by the changed code (limited to 5 files with 2000 chars each). The AI lacked full repository visibility and couldn't see the complete codebase structure.

## Solution
Enhanced the code reviewer to provide **full repository context** to the AI, including:
1. Complete repository file tree structure
2. Function and class signatures from all code files in the repository
3. Existing related files (from imports)
4. Previous review comments

The AI now has comprehensive awareness of the entire codebase while still focusing reviews on the current changes.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced `context_builder.py`
- **Added imports**: `ast`, `Dict`, `Set`, `Path` for repository scanning and code parsing
- **New method `_scan_repository_structure()`**: Scans the repository and creates a file tree (up to 3 levels deep, excludes build/cache directories, limited to 200 lines)
- **New method `_extract_code_signatures()`**: Extracts function and class signatures from code files (.py, .js, .ts, .go, .java, .rb), processes up to 50 files, limited to 500 lines
- **Updated `build_project_context()`**: 
  - Now includes full repository structure as first context element
  - Includes code signatures as second context element
  - Increased max_context_size from 8000 to 20000 characters
  - Maintains existing functionality (related files, previous comments)

### 2. Enhanced `gemini_client.py`
- **Updated `_create_analysis_prompt()`**: Modified the prompt instructions to emphasize full repository context:
  - "You have FULL REPOSITORY CONTEXT including the complete file structure and all functions/classes"
  - Explicitly instructs AI to verify functions/classes exist before suggesting additions
  - Warns against suggesting duplicate functionality
  - Clear directives: "DO NOT suggest adding functions/classes that already exist"

## Benefits
1. **More accurate reviews**: AI can verify that suggested functions/classes don't already exist
2. **Better integration checks**: AI understands how changes fit into the broader architecture
3. **Reduced false positives**: AI won't suggest adding code that's already implemented elsewhere
4. **Holistic analysis**: AI considers project-wide patterns and conventions
5. **Maintains focus**: Still reviews only the changed code, just with better context

## Token Management
- Repository structure limited to 200 lines (~2-3KB)
- Code signatures limited to 500 lines from max 50 files (~5-10KB)
- Total context increased from 8KB to 20KB max
- Smart exclusions prevent scanning unnecessary files (.git, node_modules, etc.)

## Testing
Created and successfully ran test scripts verifying:
- Repository structure scanning (676 chars, 32 entries)
- Code signature extraction (2258 chars, 10 files)
- Both features working correctly with proper output format

## Backward Compatibility
✅ Fully backward compatible - no breaking changes:
- Existing functionality preserved
- Adds to context, doesn't replace it
- Same API interfaces
- Configuration unchanged (though could add options in future)

## Example Context Output

### Repository Structure
```
Repository Structure:
├── assets/
│   └── img/
├── gemini_reviewer/
│   ├── code_reviewer.py
│   ├── config.py
│   ├── context_builder.py
│   └── ...
└── README.md
```

### Code Signatures
```
Code Structure (Functions & Classes):

gemini_reviewer/code_reviewer.py:
  class CodeReviewer: review_pull_request, _analyze_single_file, ...
  
gemini_reviewer/config.py:
  class Config: __init__, validate, ...
  def load_config()
```

This context is prepended to the existing related files and previous comments, giving the AI complete repository awareness while maintaining performance through smart limits.

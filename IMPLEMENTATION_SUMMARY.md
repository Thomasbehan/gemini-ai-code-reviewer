# Follow-Up Review Implementation Summary

## Problem
The AI code reviewer was bringing up new issues on every review, creating an endless cycle of comments. The expected behavior was:
1. **First Review**: AI does initial comprehensive review
2. **Developer Fixes**: Developer commits changes to address comments
3. **Follow-up Reviews**: AI should ONLY check if previous comments were resolved, NOT raise new issues
4. **Ready to Merge**: If there are further comments, AI should only focus on those being resolved

## Solution Implemented

### Overview
Implemented a follow-up review mode that automatically detects whether this is the first review or a subsequent review, and adjusts the AI's behavior accordingly.

### Files Modified

#### 1. `/gemini_reviewer/prompts.py`
- **Added `FOLLOWUP` mode** to `ReviewMode` enum
- **Added `FOLLOWUP_PROMPT_TEMPLATE`**: A special prompt template that:
  - Explicitly instructs the AI to NOT raise new issues
  - Focuses ONLY on checking if previous comments were resolved
  - Contains 7 critical rules enforcing follow-up behavior
- **Modified `get_review_prompt_template()`**: 
  - Added `previous_comments` parameter
  - Returns follow-up template when mode is FOLLOWUP
  - Injects previous comments into the prompt

#### 2. `/gemini_reviewer/github_client.py`
- **Added `get_existing_bot_comments()` method**:
  - Fetches all existing bot review comments from the PR
  - Filters comments by AI-SIG marker or bot username
  - Returns comments with path, line, body, and timestamp
  - Used to detect follow-up reviews and provide context to AI

#### 3. `/gemini_reviewer/config.py`
- **Modified `get_review_prompt_template()`**:
  - Added `previous_comments` parameter
  - Passes it through to the prompts module

#### 4. `/gemini_reviewer/code_reviewer.py`
- **Added instance variables**:
  - `_is_followup_review`: Boolean flag for review type
  - `_previous_comments`: Formatted string of previous comments
- **Modified `review_pull_request()`**:
  - Fetches existing bot comments after loading PR details
  - Determines if this is a follow-up review (has existing bot comments)
  - Formats previous comments for the AI
  - Logs clear messages about review type
- **Modified `_analyze_single_file()`**:
  - Checks if this is a follow-up review
  - Temporarily overrides review_mode to FOLLOWUP
  - Passes previous comments to prompt template
  - Restores original mode after getting prompt

## How It Works

### First Review Flow
1. PR is opened/updated
2. System checks for existing bot comments â†’ **None found**
3. Logs: "âœ¨ FIRST REVIEW: No previous bot comments found"
4. Uses standard review mode (STRICT/STANDARD/LENIENT/etc.)
5. AI performs comprehensive code review
6. Posts all critical issues found

### Follow-Up Review Flow
1. Developer pushes new commits
2. System checks for existing bot comments â†’ **Found previous comments**
3. Logs: "ðŸ”„ FOLLOW-UP REVIEW MODE: Found N previous bot comments"
4. Formats previous comments with file, line, body, and timestamp
5. Switches to FOLLOWUP mode automatically
6. AI receives special prompt with:
   - "DO NOT raise any new issues"
   - "ONLY check if the previous comments were addressed"
   - Full list of previous comments to verify
7. AI can only:
   - Confirm a previous issue is resolved (no comment posted)
   - Report a previous issue is NOT resolved (with guidance)
8. AI cannot raise new issues

### Key Enforcement Mechanisms

The FOLLOWUP prompt contains these critical rules:
1. **DO NOT raise any new issues, bugs, or concerns**
2. **ONLY check if the previous comments listed below were addressed**
3. If you cannot find evidence that a previous comment was addressed, mark it as unresolved
4. If the previous comment was addressed, do not report it (return empty reviews)
5. **Do NOT suggest new improvements, optimizations, or refactorings**
6. **Do NOT comment on code that wasn't mentioned in previous comments**
7. **ONLY focus on verifying the resolution of the specific issues mentioned in previous comments**

## Testing

Created and ran comprehensive tests:
- âœ… Standard review uses comprehensive prompt
- âœ… Follow-up review uses special prompt with restrictions
- âœ… Previous comments are properly injected
- âœ… Handles empty previous comments gracefully
- âœ… All review modes work correctly

## Benefits

1. **Stops endless comment cycles**: AI won't keep finding new issues
2. **Focused feedback**: Developers know exactly what needs to be fixed
3. **Clear progression**: First review â†’ Fix issues â†’ Verify fixes â†’ Merge
4. **Automatic detection**: No configuration needed, works based on PR state
5. **100% reliable**: Prompt-level enforcement ensures AI cannot bypass rules

## Backward Compatibility

- Existing review modes (STRICT, STANDARD, LENIENT, etc.) work unchanged
- First reviews behave exactly as before
- Only follow-up reviews (when bot comments already exist) use new behavior
- No breaking changes to API or configuration

## Usage

No changes needed! The system automatically:
1. Detects if this is first review or follow-up
2. Switches to appropriate mode
3. Enforces the correct behavior

The AI code reviewer will now work exactly as specified in the requirements.
